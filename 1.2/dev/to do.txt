LogType class (more types of logging... email... etc)

multiple processes log twice
hiding should not show at all
  both, I believe, will require turning into a windows application
  Will plan on having it run in service mode soon.

check bug tracker
check feature requests

allow to compile with many different icons to help hiding in whatever fashion (check legality of supplying windows icons)
