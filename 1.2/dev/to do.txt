LogType class (more types of logging... email... etc)

multiple processes log twice
hiding should not show at all
  both, I believe, will require turning into a windows application
  Will plan on having it run in service mode soon.

check bug tracker
check feature requests

allow to compile with many different icons to help hiding in whatever fashion (check legality of supplying windows icons)

re-time stamp log file every so often

in order to allow log types to utilize timers, may need to make a seperate hook


    *add support for command line paramaters that let the app react different
        could optionaly email data, or could run in debug mode, etc

destructor not called for logtype in program exit

maybe email sending should interface with localfile logtype

add support for better log hiding
