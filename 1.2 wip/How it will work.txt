myhook.cpp is the main file.
It has main(), and manages program start up.

myhook.cpp creates an instance of KeyLogger and DataLog,
then passes off control.

KeyLogger class will actually facilitate the trapping of any keystrokes.
The constructor will be passed a pointer to the DataLog object, so that 
both the myhook.cpp, and the KeyLogger class have access to it.
When any information is caught, the data will be passed from the KeyLogger
to the DataLog. Instances where the main file would need access would be
to put a timestamp at startup, or something along those lines.

DataLog is passed a "logtype" through the constructor, so that we may 
facilitate different types of logging. (email, local_file, ftp, etc)
data is "logged" through the public log() method, then a case statement
will determine which specific type of logging will take place.
All derivitive log methods will be private!
For the time being, everything will be done in the DataLog class, although
it may end up being necissary that every logtype require it's own class.
Example being email. We do not want to send an email for every character
pressed on the keyboard. It may be stored in a local file, until program 
termination, or sent every hour.
